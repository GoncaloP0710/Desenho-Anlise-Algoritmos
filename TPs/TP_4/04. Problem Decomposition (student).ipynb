    "The characteristic that problems must have, for DP to be used, is that they exhibit _overlapping subproblems_, meaning that subproblems share common sub-subproblems. When this occurs, a divide-and-conquer solution will inevitably perform more computation than necessary. What a DP algorithm does is store the solutions of the subproblems it solves, so that they can be reused later. This allows for the creation of algorithms with better time complexity at the cost of some increase in space complexity.\n",
